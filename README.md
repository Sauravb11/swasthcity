# 🏙️ SwasthCity

**Report civic issues. Get them resolved.**

SwasthCity is a full-stack civic engagement platform that gives residents a fast, transparent way to report neighborhood problems — potholes, broken streetlights, garbage, water leaks, graffiti, fallen trees — and gives local authorities the tools to triage, assign, and resolve them in the open.

Snap a photo, let AI fill in the details, and watch the report move from **Reported → Accepted → In Progress → Resolved** in full public view.

## ✨ Features

### For citizens
- 📸 **Photo-first reporting** — capture or upload a photo and pin a location; the report is ready to submit in under a minute.
- 🤖 **AI-assisted triage** — an AI vision model looks at the photo and automatically drafts a title, description, category, severity, and the department it should be routed to.
- 🧭 **Smart duplicate detection** — before you submit, SwasthCity searches nearby reports (within 100m) and uses AI to check whether your issue is already being tracked, so you can add support instead of filing a duplicate.
- 🗺️ **Community map** — an interactive map of every open issue nearby, filterable by status.
- 🔔 **Live status tracking** — a full audit trail of status changes, notes, and resolution photos for every report you file.
- 👍 **Community support** — back reports your neighbors have already filed to help surface what matters most.

### For authorities
- 🛡️ **Authority dashboard** — a queue of all incoming reports across the city, with reporter info attached.
- ✅ **Status & assignment workflow** — accept, reject (with a required reason), assign to a team/person, and move issues through to resolution (with a required resolution photo).
- 📊 **Analytics** — breakdowns of issues by category, severity, and status to spot trends and bottlenecks.
- 📁 **Assigned-to-me view** — a personal queue for whoever is handling a given issue.
- 🕵️ **Full transparency** — every status change is timestamped and attributed, building public trust in the resolution process.

### Platform
- 🔐 Role-based accounts (**Citizen** vs **Authority**) with a guided onboarding/profile-completion flow.
- 🔒 Row-level security enforced in Postgres — citizens only see their own reports; authorities are gated by a `has_role`-style RPC check.
- ⚡ Server-rendered, type-safe data fetching via TanStack Start server functions — no separate REST/GraphQL layer to maintain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or Node.js 18+ with npm/pnpm as an alternative)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project
- A Google Maps API key (for the community map)
- A Lovable AI Gateway key, or another OpenAI-compatible provider key, for AI-powered triage & duplicate detection

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaushik-Ltd/SwasthCity-spotlight.git
cd SwasthCity-spotlight
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Supabase
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-anon-key"
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-anon-key"

# Google Maps
VITE_LOVABLE_CONNECTOR_GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY="your-google-maps-key"
VITE_LOVABLE_CONNECTOR_GOOGLE_MAPS_TRACKING_ID="your-tracking-id"

# AI Gateway (server-side only — used for photo triage & duplicate detection)
LOVABLE_API_KEY="your-ai-gateway-key"
```

> ⚠️ Never commit real keys. Rotate any keys that were previously exposed in a public `.env` file.

### 4. Set up the database

Apply the migrations in `supabase/migrations/` to your Supabase project (via the Supabase CLI or dashboard SQL editor) to create the `profiles`, `reports`, `status_history`, and `report_supporters` tables along with their RLS policies and RPC functions.

### 5. Run the dev server

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port Vite reports).

### Other scripts

```bash
bun run build       # Production build
bun run build:dev   # Development-mode build
bun run preview     # Preview a production build locally
bun run lint         # Run ESLint
bun run format       # Format with Prettier
```

## 🔄 How a Report Flows

1. **Citizen submits a report** — takes/uploads a photo, and SwasthCity's AI drafts the title, description, category, severity, and responsible department.
2. **Duplicate check** — nearby reports of the same category are compared by AI against the new photo/description; if a strong match is found, the citizen can support the existing report instead.
3. **Authority reviews** — the report lands in the authority queue, where it can be accepted, rejected (with a reason), or assigned to a team/individual.
4. **Progress is tracked** — every status change is written to a public `status_history` timeline, visible to the reporter and community.
5. **Resolution** — marking a report "Resolved" requires a resolution photo, closing the loop with visual proof.
